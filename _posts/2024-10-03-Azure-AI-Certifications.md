With all the AI buzz going around, I thought it would be a good idea to get an Azure AI certification. 

So, I am happy to get a new Azure certification, this time it's Azure AI Engineer Associate, which I achieved by taking the following exams:

 - [AI-900](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/) exam. 
  
 - [AI-102](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/) exam.
