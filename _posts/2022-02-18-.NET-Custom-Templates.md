summary:    A lap around .NET Custom templating engine.

On one of my recent projects around serverless, we were creating lots of microservices and each microservice was its own Visual Studio Solution. Since there were lots of dev teams involved inbuilding these services, we wanted to standardize on a solution structure which could be easily adopted across different teams. 

We were looking for an automated way to so that devs across these teams could quickly and easily create consistent solutions and this is what led me to fiddle with [Custom .NET Templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates).

This post explores those steps and so lets get started:

If you read through the previous link, you can see that the .NET custom templating engine has been significantly evolved in .NET core 2 and its now relatively very easy to create a custom template.

Our solutions were following a very standard project structure as shown below:

Solution_Structure
│   Microservice.csproj
│
└───Documentation
    ├───Documentation.csproj
└───Source
    │   │   console.cs
    
    └───Shared
        ├───Domain.csproj
    │   └───.template.config
    │           template.json
    │
    └───mytemplate2
        │   otherfile.cs
        │
        └───.template.config
                template.json
