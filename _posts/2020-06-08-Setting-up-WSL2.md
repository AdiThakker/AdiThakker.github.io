So far, I have used my office laptop for blogging and that has WSL installed. I wanted to download WSL 2 on it but couldn't as the Windows version is controlled by corporate IT. I had a personal laptop sitting around, so I decided to use that for my blog using WSL 2. 

The first thing I wanted to download was the new [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701), so I headed to the Windows Store and got it. ***Note:*** If you would like to customize the terminal, there are some nice instructions on how to do it by Scott Hanselman [here](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToMakeAPrettyPromptInWindowsTerminalWithPowerlineNerdFontsCascadiaCodeWSLAndOhmyposh.aspx). Following is my Sorin theme:

The instructions on getting [started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) with WSL are very well documented and so I started there.

Firstly, I updated my Windows version to the one that supports WSL 2, shown here:

![Setup]({{site.url}}/images/Win-ver.png)

As instructed, I then enabled Windows Subsystem for Linux as shown below:

```Powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```

And then enabled Virtual Machine Platform by running:

```Powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

After the restart, when I tried to set WSL default version to 2, I got a message stating ***WSL 2 requires an update to its kernel component***, so I proceeded with the update as shown below by downloading it from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-kernel)

Next was installing [Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) from Windows Store, setting up username, password, update default version to 2 and quick verification via:

I already had VS Code and git installed on my laptop so I went ahead with VS Code update and launched it from command line as indicated [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode) which installed VS Code server and then launched it. Once VS Code started, it prompted me to install Remote - WSL extension, which I proceeded with. This extension enables you to use WSL as your full-time development environment directly from VS Code and lets you develop in a Linux based environment. The previous link explains more about its functionality, so I won't bore you here ðŸ˜‰.

OK, so the next step was to clone my repo and start installing Jekyll. But before that, I had to do a quick system packages update in the VS Code bash terminal via:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade
```

Now, Jekyll requires a working Ruby development environment which includes libraries, so I then executed commands to install Jekyll and required build tools as follows:

```bash
sudo apt -y install make build-essential
sudo apt -y install ruby ruby-dev
```

Next, I had to install Bundler which is a tool used to manage Gem dependencies via:

```bash
gem install bundler
```

And then finally Jekyll via:

```bash
bundle install
gem install jekyll
```

***Note:*** when running bundle install, I got an error for nokogiri dependency which I was able to resolve by issuing command which is mentioned on their [site](https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html):

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential patch ruby-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev
gem install nokogiri
```

After which, I was able to successfully build the Jekyll site via:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

There are still some minor tweaks needed for my dev env. on my personal laptop, which I'll be updating soon... but for now I am able to work on my blog from my personal laptop, So more to come!!!
