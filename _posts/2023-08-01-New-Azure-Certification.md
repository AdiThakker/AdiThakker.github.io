It's always a good time to [renew]({{site.url}}/Azure-DevOps-Renewed) and/or get new Azure Certifications, while you are in between projects.

So, I am happy to get a new Azure certification, this time it's Azure Security Engineer Associate. Security is one of the most important aspects of any cloud solution, so it's good to have a certification in this area. I achieved by taking the [AZ-500](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-security-engineer/) exam.

Now back to blogging! In the next few posts, I will be writing about IaC using Bicep and YAML. Stay tuned!
