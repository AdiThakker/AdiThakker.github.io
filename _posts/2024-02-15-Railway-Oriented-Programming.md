I am huge fan of F# and functional programming in general. I have previously used F# mainly for learning purposes and for small projects. I have always been fascinated by the concept of Railway Oriented Programming (ROP) and how it can be used to handle errors in a functional way.

In this post we will see how we can leverage those concepts in .NET. mainly using C#.

## What is Railway Oriented Programming?
ROP, a functional programming concept, visualizes error handling like two parallel train tracks: one for success and one for failure. It simplifies the process of handling errors, making your code more readable and maintainable.

So, instead of using exceptions, we can use ROP to handle errors in a more functional way. This is done by chaining functions together, where each function returns a result that can be either a success or a failure. This result is then passed to the next function in the chain, which can then decide what to do based on the result.

## Our Reference example

All the source code is uploaded [here](https://github.com/AdiThakker/ROP) 

### Result Type

We start by defining a result interface and class, IResult<TSuccess, TFailure> and Result<TSuccess, TFailure>. This serves as the foundation, encapsulating either a success value or a failure value as shown below.

~~~csharp
public interface IResult<TSuccess, TFailure>
{
}

public class Result<TSuccess, TFailure> : IResult<TSuccess, TFailure>
{
    public TSuccess Success { get; set; }

    public TFailure Failure { get; set; }

    public Result(TSuccess success)
    {
        Success = success;
        Failure = default;
    }

    public Result(TFailure failure)
    {
        Failure = failure;
        Success = default;
    }

    public void Deconstruct(out TSuccess? success, out TFailure? failure) { success = Success; failure = Failure; }
}
~~~

Think your function as two parallel tracks. The success track continues when operations are successful. The failure track is taken when an error occurs. With Railway Oriented Programming, these tracks never intersect, simplifying error handling, the key that makes this work is the Bind function.

### Bind function

Think of Bind as a switch on the railway. If the incoming train (input) is on the success track, Bind applies a function to transform the value. If it's on the failure track, Bind passes the failure along without applying the function. This method elegantly handles the switch between success and failure paths, which is shown below:

~~~csharp
public static Func<Result<TValue, TFailure>, Result<TSuccess, TFailure>> Bind<TValue, TSuccess, TFailure>(Func<TValue, Result<TSuccess, TFailure>> map)
{
    return input =>
        {
            var (success, failure) = input;
            return (success, failure) switch
            {
                (_, null) => map(success),
                (null, _) => new Result<TSuccess,TFailure>(failure),
                _ => throw new NotImplementedException(),
            };
        };
}
~~~

To make the Bind function easily attachable (if that's a word ðŸ˜‰) is an extension method, as shown below which can help **adapt and/or chain** functions:

~~~csharp
public static Result<TSuccess, TFailure> Then<TValue, TSuccess, TFailure>(this Result<TValue, TFailure> instance, Func<TValue, Result<TSuccess, TFailure>> map) => Bind(map)(instance);
~~~

Now lets look at how this plays out in our validation example, using the above constructs.

### Validation Example

Let's say we have a Customer class and we want to validate the Name and Age properties. We can create a CustomerResult class that inherits from Result and then create a CustomerValidation class that contains the validation methods. The validation methods will return a CustomerResult, which can then be chained together using the Then method.
 

~~~csharp
public class Customer
{
    public string? Name { get; set; }

    public int Age { get; set; }
}

public class CustomerResult : Result<Customer, Exception>
{
    public CustomerResult(Customer success) : base(success) { }

    public CustomerResult(Exception error) : base(error) { }
}

public static class CustomerValidation
{
    public static CustomerResult ValidateName(Customer customer) => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(customer.Name) ? new CustomerResult(customer) : new CustomerResult(new InvalidDataException("Name cannot be empty"));

    public static CustomerResult ValidateAge(Customer customer) => customer.Age is > 0 and < 100 ? new CustomerResult(customer) : new CustomerResult(new InvalidDataException("Age Invalid"));
}

Customer customer = new Customer();
customer.Name = "";
customer.Age = 10;

var result = CustomerValidation.ValidateName(customer).Then(CustomerValidation.ValidateAge);
Console.WriteLine(result.Success  is null ? result.Failure : result.Success);
~~~

You can see in the above that even though ValidateName and ValidateAge take Customer as input, since they return CustomerResult, the can be chained using the Then "adapter" method.

So there you see a simple fluent invocation of the validation methods using ROP. 

If you are interested in reading more about his pattern, you are look at Scott Wlaschin's [Railway Oreiented Programming ](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/recipe-part2/) post.He also refers to this as [Pipeline Oriented Programming] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipceTuJlw-M).
