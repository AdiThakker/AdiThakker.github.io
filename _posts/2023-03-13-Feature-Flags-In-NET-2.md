Hello Folks! I have returned after a significant break and recently wrapped up a project. Therefore, I now have some spare time to resume blogging, allowing us to pick up from where we last left off ðŸ˜Š. Now, let's continue with this post, which serves as a continuation of our [previous]({{site.url}}/Feature-Flags-In-NET-1) discussion on Feature Flags in .NET.

If you have read through the previous post, you know that the essence of the Time Window feature evaluation is mainly in its [TimeWindowFeatureFilter](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Dotnet/blob/main/src/Microsoft.FeatureManagement/FeatureFilters/TimeWindowFilter.cs), where it evaluates [TimeWindowFilterSettings](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Dotnet/blob/main/src/Microsoft.FeatureManagement/FeatureFilters/TimeWindowFilterSettings.cs). Based on how its configured, it uses the built-in [ConfigurationFeatureDefinitionProvider](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Dotnet/blob/main/src/Microsoft.FeatureManagement/ConfigurationFeatureDefinitionProvider.cs) to construct its [FeatureDefinition](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Dotnet/blob/main/src/Microsoft.FeatureManagement/FeatureDefinition.cs). This is all very nice, as long as you are using one of the preexisiting filters. 

***But what if you want to implement your own Custom logic for a feature evaluation?***

That's where we enter [ContextualFeatureFilter](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Dotnet/blob/main/src/Microsoft.FeatureManagement/IContextualFeatureFilter.cs). By implementing this interface, you can customize logic for feature evaluation, and that's what we will look at in this post.

***NOTE: I have made updates to the source code since my previous post to utilize the ContextualFeatureFilter. Please make sure to refer to the latest code in the [repository](https://github.com/AdiThakker/FeatureManagement) for the most recent version.***

In the previous post, we already had implemented a feature called ***VerboseLogging***, which leveraged  [TimeWindow](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Dotnet/blob/main/src/Microsoft.FeatureManagement/FeatureFilters/TimeWindowFilter.cs) for its evaluation. In this example, we will add a ***new feature*** called ***AddressLogging***, which will display address, if it matches our configured criteria.

So let's get started!!!

## Configuration

We again, leverage ***appSettings.json*** for configuration. 

~~~json
"FeatureManagement": {
    "VerboseLogging": {
      "EnabledFor": [
        {
          "Name": "TimeWindow",
          "Parameters": {
            "End": "01/08/2023 12:00:00"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
   "AddressLogging": {                  // Feature name
      "EnabledFor": [
        {
          "Name": "PersonAddress",      // Filter Condition (without Filter suffix)
          "Parameters": {
            "Address": "Famous Street"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }  
~~~

The key thing to note here is that we have added a new feature called ***AddressLogging***, which is enabled for a filter called ***PersonAddress***. We will look at this filter implementation in the next section. 

## Custom Filter

~~~csharp
 public class PersonAddressFilter : IContextualFeatureFilter<Person>
{        
    public Task<bool> EvaluateAsync(FeatureFilterEvaluationContext featureFilterContext, Person appContext)
    {
        _ = featureFilterContext ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(featureFilterContext));
        _ = appContext ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(appContext));

        var printAddressFilterConfig = featureFilterContext.Parameters.Get<Person>();
        if(printAddressFilterConfig != null)
        {
            return Task.FromResult(string.Equals(printAddressFilterConfig.Address, appContext.Address, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase));
        }

        return Task.FromResult(false);
    }
}
~~~

Our [PersonAddressFilter](https://github.com/AdiThakker/FeatureManagement/blob/main/FeatureManagement.Console/FeatureManagement/Filters/PersonAddressFilter.cs) implements the [IContextualFeatureFilter](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Dotnet/blob/main/src/Microsoft.FeatureManagement/IContextualFeatureFilter.cs) and its ***EvaluateAsync*** method takes in a ***FeatureFilterEvaluationContext*** and a ***Person*** object. 

The [FeatureFilterEvaluationContext](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Dotnet/blob/main/src/Microsoft.FeatureManagement/FeatureFilterEvaluationContext.cs) is the context used by [IFeatureFilter](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Dotnet/blob/main/src/Microsoft.FeatureManagement/IFeatureFilter.cs) to gain insight into what feature is being evaluated and the parameters needed to check whether the feature should be enabled. Our [Person](https://github.com/AdiThakker/FeatureManagement/blob/main/FeatureManagement.Console/Person.cs) object is the instance that we is used to evaluate our custom logic against. 

The key point in the above case is, if the person's address matches the address configured in the ***appsettings.json***, then the feature is enabled, otherwise it is disabled.


### Filter Registration

~~~csharp
public static class FeatureManagerExtensions
{
    public static IServiceCollection AddFeatureConfiguration(this IServiceCollection collection, Action<IFeatureManagementBuilder> addFeatureFilters = null)
    {
        var featureBuilder = collection.AddFeatureManagement().AddFeatureFilter<TimeWindowFilter>();

        // add additional feature filters if any
        addFeatureFilters?.Invoke(featureBuilder);

        return collection;
    }
}
~~~

Our custom extension [FeatureManagerExtensions](https://github.com/AdiThakker/FeatureManagement/blob/main/FeatureManagement.Console/FeatureManagement/FeatureManagerExtensions.cs) class, is used to register our filters. It's ***AddFeatureConfiguration*** method takes in an ***Action*** delegate, which is used to register additional filters. 

In our case, we will use it to register our ***PersonAddressFilter*** and that's shown below in our [Program](https://github.com/AdiThakker/FeatureManagement/blob/main/FeatureManagement.Console/Program.cs). You can see the call to ***AddFeatureFilter***, which takes in our ***PersonAddressFilter***.

~~~csharp
var app = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()
    .ConfigureLogging((loggingBuilder) =>
    {
        loggingBuilder.AddConsole();
    })
    .ConfigureServices(services =>
    {
        services.AddFeatureConfiguration(_ => _.AddFeatureFilter<PersonAddressFilter>());
        services.AddTransient<IFeatureFlagManagement, FeatureFlagManagement>();

    })
    .Build();
~~~

### Filter Evaluation

***This part of code is modified from our previous post***, I have moved the feature evaluation logic to a separate [PersonExtensions](https://github.com/AdiThakker/FeatureManagement/blob/main/FeatureManagement.Console/PersonExtensions.cs) class as shown below.

~~~csharp
public static class PersonExtensions
{
    public static async Task<string> Display(this Person person, IFeatureFlagManagement featureManager) => await featureManager.IsFeatureEnabledAsync(person) switch
    {
        true => string.Concat("Verbose Logging enabled: ", person.Name, " - ", person.Address),
        _ => string.Concat("Verbose Logging disabled: ", person.Name)
    };

    public static async Task<string> CustomDisplay(this Person person, IFeatureFlagManagement featureManager) => await featureManager.IsFeatureEnabledAsync("AddressLogging", person) switch
    {
        true => string.Concat("Address Logging enabled: ", person.Name, " - ", person.Address),
        _ => string.Concat("Address Logging disabled: ", person.Name)
    };
}
~~~

The new ***CustomDisplay*** method is now added, which takes in the ***IFeatureFlagManagement*** instance and uses it to evaluate the ***AddressLogging*** feature. 

This is done by passing in the ***Person*** object and the ***FeatureName*** to the [FeatureFlagManagement's](https://github.com/AdiThakker/FeatureManagement/blob/main/FeatureManagement.Console/FeatureManagement/FeatureFlagManagement.cs) ***IsFeatureEnabledAsync*** method.

### Running Sample

Following snippet from our [Program](https://github.com/AdiThakker/FeatureManagement/blob/main/FeatureManagement.Console/Program.cs) class shows how we use the ***IFeatureFlagManagement*** instance to evaluate the feature.

~~~csharp
var featureManager = app.Services.GetService<IFeatureFlagManagement>()!;

// Time Window logging feature
var person = new Person();
Console.WriteLine(await person.Display(featureManager));

// Address logging feature (disabled)
Console.WriteLine(await person.CustomDisplay(featureManager));

// Address logging feature (enabled)
person.Address = "Famous Street";
Console.WriteLine(await person.CustomDisplay(featureManager));
~~~

When we run the application, we see the following output.

That's all Folks!!! This completes our series on Feature Management. I hope you found this useful. We'll most likely revisit this topic in the future, esp. around [Azure App Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview) as I am sure there will be more to come in this space.
