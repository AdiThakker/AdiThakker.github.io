Continuing with my Azure [certifications]({{site.url}}/Azure-Certification-Renewed), I am happy to share that today... I passed my first DevOps exam [AZ - 400: Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-400).

Now, the next one to target is [AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-204), in order to complete the [DevOps Engineer Expert](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/devops-engineer/) series. ðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž
