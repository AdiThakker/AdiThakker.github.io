summary:    A lap around .NET Core Custom templating engine.

On one of my recent projects around serverless, we were creating lots of microservices and each microservice was its own Visual Studio Solution. Since there were lots of dev teams involved building these services, we wanted to standardize on a solution structure which could be easily adopted across different teams. 

We were looking to automate the scaffolding of these solutions, so that devs across these different teams could quickly and easily create consistent solutions and this is where we started looking at [Custom .NET Templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates).

In this post we will see how we leveraged that feature:

If you read through the previous link, you can see that the .NET custom templating engine has been significantly evolved in .NET core 2 and its now relatively very easy to create a custom template.

Our solutions were following a very consistent structure, which is shown below:

~~~text
Microservice.sln
│   .editorconfig
|
└───Documentation
    ├───Documentation.
    |
└───Source
    ├───Service.csproj  
        │   Startup.cs
    |  
    └───Shared
        ├───Domain.csproj
        |
 └───Testing
    ├───IntegrationTest.csproj 
        │   Program.cs
    |  
    ├───UnitTest.csproj 
~~~

So, my first step was to create this solution strucutre and templatize the variables which could be substituted whent the final solution was created. Now the heart of this is [template.json]() which is shown below:

~~~json
{
  "$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/template",
  "author": "Adi Thakker",
  "classifications": [ "Solution", "Service" ],
  "identity": "Adi.FunctionAppTemplate.CSharp",
  "name": "Adi Thakker Custom function app template",
  "shortName": "adifunctionappservice",
  "tags": {
    "language": "C#",
    "type": "solution"
  },
  "symbols": {
    "company": {
      "type": "parameter",
      "isRequired": true,
      "datatype": "text",
      "replaces": "Company",
      "defaultValue": "Your Company name",
      "fileRename": "Company"
    },
    "application": {
      "type": "parameter",
      "isRequired": true,
      "datatype": "text",
      "replaces": "Application",
      "defaultValue": "Your Application name",
      "fileRename": "Application"
    },
    "component": {
      "type": "parameter",
      "isRequired": true,
      "datatype": "text",
      "replaces": "Component",
      "defaultValue": "Your Component name",
      "fileRename": "Component"
    },
    "includeIntegrationTest": {
      "type": "parameter",
      "datatype": "bool",
      "defaultValue": "true"
    }
  },
  "sources": [
    {
      "modifiers": [
        {
          "condition": "(!includeIntegrationTest)",
          "exclude": [ "Testing/Company.Application.Component.IntegrationTest/**" ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "preferNameDirectory": true
}
~~~

The docs do an excellent job of explaining the file in detail, so i will only focus on the symbols here, which we leveraged to .
 our project naming was following a conventions like {Company}.{Application}.{Component}.<>.csproj, so we templatized all those under the symbols element.

 Also inorder to make our integrationtest project generation options, you can see the we leveraged that using includeIntegrationTest option.


In order to test this structure, the next step was to install the template locally 

~~~text

dotnet new --install <PATH_TO_FOLDER_CONTAINING_TEMPLATE.CONFIG_FOLDER>

~~~


Once the template was exported, check the installed templates by

~~~text
dontnet new --list
~~~

It should show up in the list of installed templates

Now actual creation

~~~
dotnet new 
~~~

Once the parameters we supplied.

The final output...

This technique has really expedited our consistent microservice creation you can export this into a NuGet package by 
updating the .csproj file

~~~
