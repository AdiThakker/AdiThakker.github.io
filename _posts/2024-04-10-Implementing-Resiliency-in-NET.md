Over the last weekend, I was trying to explain resiliency as a concept to a team of developers and how it can be implemented in .NET. This post is the outcome of that discussion.

In the world of software development, resiliency is key to maintaining robust and reliable applications, especially in distributed environments where failures are not just possibleâ€”they are inevitable. A resilient application can gracefully handle and recover from failures, ensuring minimal disruption to the user experience. The two concepts on which this builds are [Retries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/retry) and [Circuit Breaker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker) patterns.

**NOTE**: I'll not explain the above concepts as the links provided are more than enough to understand them. However just to give a brief overview:

- **Retries** is a fundamental strategy for handling transient failures (like temporary network issues). By automatically retrying a failed request, applications can often overcome a failure that is only temporary in nature, but this can also lead to cascading failures if not implemented correctly, Hence, the Circuit Breaker pattern.
  
- **Circuit Breaker** pattern helps control an interaction with an external system by stopping cascading failures and giving the failing system time to recover. It also helps to avoid the situation where an application is continuously trying to execute an operation that will always fail, allowing it to gracefully degrade functionality when needed.

so with that said, let's dive into how you can enhance the resiliency of your .NET applications using retries and the Circuit Breaker pattern.

All of the code is uploaded [here](https://github.com/AdiThakker/projects/tree/main/ResiliencySample)

**NOTE**: This code was built in a short time and is just to explain the concepts. For production use, you should use powerful libraries like [Polly](https://www.pollydocs.org/)
